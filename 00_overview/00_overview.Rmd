## Objectives of this course {.build}

* refresh your statistical knowledge
* learn some new methods and techniques
* compare different methods for the same problem
* discuss how to decide on the best statistical method for the given problem
* see some statistical analyses in action


## Rules

* if you have a question - ask!
* don't expect me to be able to give a clear-cut answer (each time)


## Topics

* mean differences of groups
* nested data
* dimensionality reduction
* finding groups in data


## Procedure

* I have prepared some slides
  - with information
  - with analyses
  - (all slides are written in R - if there is an example, then the data and all analyses are in there)
  
* I will ask questions
* hopefully, you will too


## What this course is not?

* an R course (but I can recommend [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) by H. Wickham)
* a "how-to" - all code is there, but you don't need to memorize it
* a coverage of all "advanced" statistical methods


## Grades

* there will be a test at the end of the semester


## Resources

* all my materials for this course can be found at the git hub repo [bpiskernik/2022_SA_advanced_statistical_methods](https://github.com/bpiskernik/2022_SA_advanced_statistical_methods) 
* the slides will be in moodle
* the slides contain links to additional material (for those who are interested)
